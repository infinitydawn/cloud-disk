did not understand 7 and 8, rewatch and/or look for tutorials

lesson 9 - finished, understood, but many details, will not remember.

finished 10: overall understood everything, but a lot of small details

Finished 11& 12: Overall learning new things, but it is confusing and many small details to remember. One problem is redux
